= Neo4j SDN and OGM  Formatting Settings

This directory contains `eclipse-formatting.xml` and `springdata.importorder` settings files to be used with Eclipse and IntelliJ. 
The settings are the same as used by https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-commons[Spring Data] with the minor difference having new lines after annotations on fields.

== Eclipse Setup

Import both files in Eclipse through the Preferences dialog.

== IntelliJ Setup

Use the IntelliJ https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546-eclipse-code-formatter[Eclipse Code Formatter] plugin to configure code formatting and import ordering with the newest Eclipse formatter version.

Additionally, make sure to configure your import settings in `Editor -> Code Style -> Java` with the following explicit settings:

* Use tab character indents
* Class count to use import with `*`: 10
* Names count to use static import with `*`: 1
